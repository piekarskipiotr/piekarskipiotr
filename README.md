## Hi 👋🏻  I'm Piotr 🧑🏻‍💻

<p>I'm a mobile app developer. I started with Android app development using Java, and later switched to Kotlin. Currently, I'm working in the cross-platform area using Flutter 💙, which is a fantastic framework that I hope to stick with for a while.

Besides coding, I like to go swimming, watch good TV shows, eat pizza (pepperoni is a must 🍕), play video games, and listen to good music.</p>
